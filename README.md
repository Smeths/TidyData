# My Readme file for the course project

The r script run_analysis.R will take data in from the following files

* activity_labels.txt
* subject_test.txt
* subject_train.txt
* X_test.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_test.txt
* y_train.txt

Which need to be present in the same directory as the script

The script performs the following tasks

1, Merges the training and test data
2, Extracts the mean accelerations and the standard deviation accelerations
3, Calculates averages of this data per subject and per activity
4, Outputs these averages to activiy.txt
